## Market Analysis: Modern Flashcard Standards (Gap Analysis)
*Research based on 2024-2025 Industry Leaders (Anki, Quizlet, RemNote)*

To reach "State of the Art" status, the following features are standard in modern AI flashcard tools:

1.  **Multimedia & Visuals**:
    *   **AI Image Generation**: Automatically generating mnemonic images for concepts (e.g., *Midjourney/DALL-E integration*).
    *   **Image Occlusion**: Handling diagrams by hiding labels for testing (Crucial for medical/anatomy students).

2.  **Advanced Algorithms**:
    *   **True Spaced Repetition (SRS)**: Implementing SM-2 or FSRS algorithms to schedule reviews based on user performance ratings (Example: "Easy," "Good," "Hard," "Again").
    *   **Interleaving**: Mixing different topics automatically to improve retention.

3.  **Interoperability**:
    *   **Anki/CSV Export**: The ability to export decks to the extensive ecosystem of established flashcard apps.
    *   **Mobile Sync**: Offline-first mobile experience (Progressive Web App).

4.  **Gamification & Social**:
    *   **Streaks & Heatmaps**: Visualizing daily consistency.
    *   **Leaderboards**: Comparative metrics.

5.  **Contextual AI Tutor**:
    *   **"Explain This Card"**: A chat interface specifically scoped to the context of a single difficult card.
