1. clicking on new session after completing a quiz crashes the mode with black screen...

2.flascrad text shouldnot be scroable......all text should fit inside the crad....in single mode the ui seems still broken...use a better structure....and utilize the space


3. quiz/flashcard chat is not formatted...it should follow the exact prompt and setup as chatmode....reuse chatmode feature here 

now fix all iissues one by one
