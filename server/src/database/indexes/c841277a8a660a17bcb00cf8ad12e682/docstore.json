Introduction The determination of a substance's molar mass is a fundamental procedure in analytical chemistry. This experiment determines the exact concentration of a supplied sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution by titration with a primary-standard weak acid, succinic acid (C₄H₆O₄). A known volume of 0.050 M succinic acid is neutralized with NaOH to a phenolphthalein endpoint, and from the stoichiometric relation, the molarity of NaOH is calculated. 2. Theory Succinic acid (H₂C₄H₄O₄) is a diprotic acid that donates two protons to a strong base such as NaOH. At the equivalence point, the stoichiometric relation establishes a 1:2 mole ratio. Phenolphthalein is appropriate because the equivalence region for a weak acid-strong base titration lies on the basic side where the indicator changes from colorless to pink.

Results and Discussion The standardized NaOH molarity is 0.105 M , based on an average titrant volume of 9.5 mL for 10.00 mL of 0.050 M succinic acid. The positive deviation (5.26% error) suggests a slightly higher NaOH concentration than nominal, potentially from CO₂ absorption during storage, slight endpoint overshoot, or reading uncertainties. 7.

Conclusion The NaOH solution was successfully standardized using 0.050 M succinic acid with phenolphthalein as indicator. The determined concentration is approximately 0.105 M , slightly higher than the nominal 0.100 M. Despite minor experimental errors such as endpoint overshooting, reading inaccuracies, or CO₂ absorption, the titration provides a reliable determination of NaOH concentration. Future improvements include careful drop-by-drop titration near the endpoint, storing NaOH in sealed containers with CO₂ traps, and ensuring proper meniscus reading at eye level. 8. Answer the Following Questions: 1. What is monoprotic, diprotic and triprotic acid? Monoprotic acid: An acid that donates only one proton (H⁺ ion) per molecule when dissolved in solution. Examples include HCl (hydrochloric acid), HNO₃ (nitric acid), and CH₃COOH (acetic acid). Diprotic acid: An acid that can donate two protons (H⁺ ions) per molecule to an aqueous solution.

Examples include H₂SO₄ (sulfuric acid) and H₂C₄H₄O₄ (succinic acid). The two protons are typically released in two distinct steps. Triprotic acid: An acid capable of donating three protons (H⁺ ions) per molecule. An example is H₃PO₄ (phosphoric acid), which releases its protons in three sequential steps. 2. Why phenolphthalein is used as a suitable indicator for this titration? Phenolphthalein is used as a suitable indicator for this titration because: It has a pH transition range of approximately 8.2 to 10.0, changing from colorless to pink/magenta. This range is ideal for weak acid-strong base titrations, where the equivalence point occurs in the slightly basic pH region (typically around pH 8-9). Since NaOH (strong base) is being used to titrate H₂C₄H₄O₄ (weak diprotic acid), the equivalence point will be above pH 7, making phenolphthalein an appropriate choice.
