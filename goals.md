thiink like that i upload a document and i want to make a perefct note....so here are some simple expamples of what a proper notes contains.....(these are just examples)...

so note mode should generate a perefct note as need......then format it into different blocks as needed...block is just a tool to represent the data but main data should be accurate and useful...now i want you to redesign the note mode where ai will be instrocuted to first  make a note and then fit the note with the aviabkle blocks(in one request not multiple) now you redesign the note mode by adding more block support for better output..
