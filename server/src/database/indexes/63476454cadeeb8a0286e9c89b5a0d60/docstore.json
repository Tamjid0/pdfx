Used in design (web, print, graphic) to show how a layout will look with content. Purpose and Benefits Lets designers focus on visual elements like fonts, spacing, and colors without distraction from actual meaning. Fills space in documents or webpages during development. Helps evaluate typography, layout, and design before real text is ready. Maintains neutrality, preventing readers from getting caught up in the words instead of the design. Key Characteristics Acts as a temporary stand-in for final content (Placeholder). Resembles real text but conveys no message. Origins Origins trace back centuries to the printing industry.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}]],{"0":"42a16409-9fa9-46b3-bf3e-eeb6a36b3154"}]
