It fills space in documents or webpages during development, resembling real text but conveying no message, with origins tracing back centuries to the printing industry. Key characteristics & purpose: ● Placeholder: Acts as a temporary stand-in for final content. ● Focus on visuals: Helps evaluate typography, layout, and design before real text is ready. ● Neutrality: Prevents readers from getting caught up in the words instead of the design.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}]],{"0":"d2f911ca-69e5-4470-a118-e39054f294d0"}]
