tasks:
1. when in quiz or flashcard or relevent modes let user hide the artboard or editor with a eye icon which will cover the editor or artboard or pdf or slide with hidden overlay


2. in flashcard mode let user switch between one card at a time(which will show like quiz exam one card then another with chnager button) or all card (current view)...

3. from now on let let ai also send hint through uuid lik chatmode for quiz like for mathmatical things ai will generate a question also will send a hint with answer let user click on hint that will let user go to that section in the pdf or slide(just like chat mode) and highlight them...
also include this feature in exam mode only when exam is finished let user see the answer and explanation form the pdf or slide...

4. Another important feature this is completely new....let user ask detail question about a quiz or flashcard so give a option to export them(that quiz or flashcard) into chat mode(graphically) and it will work like an attachment and let user add question or queries about that quiz or flashcard.....

but there is a small problem currently quiz/flashcard and chatmode is seperate feature...my plan is open the chatmode in a colsapable unit in other mode where needed like were talking about chat or quiz....when a quiz is imported in chatmode chatmode should never cover the entire quiz/flashcardmode....im cofused about the ui....if you have a better place or idea for chat mode integration in otehr mode use that idea....but one thing when switched to orignal chat mode immeditale that chatmode should close....but these chat mode should be parallal should be updated parelally


this is for now impllement these feature no.4 is the most important part
