Mozammel Huq Azad Khan, Professor, CSE, EWU Page 10 The Inclusion - Exclusion Principle When a part of two tasks can be done at the same time, we cannot use the sum rule to count the number of ways to do one of the two tasks. Adding the number of ways to do each task leads to an overcount , since the ways to do the part in both tasks are counted twice. To correctly count the number of ways to do one of the two tasks, we add the number of ways to do each of the two tasks and then subtract the number of ways to do the part of both tasks. This technique is called the principle of inclusion - exclusion . Example: How many bit strings of length eight start with a 1 bit or end with the two bits 00?

Constructing a bit string of length eight that begins with a 1 and ends with 00 can be done in 2 5 = 32 ways. Consequently, the number of bit strings of length eight that begin with a 1 or end with a 00 equals 128 + 64 – 32 = 160. Md.
