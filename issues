1.  chats showos typing animationtion even after ai reply ends
2. Here is a flowchart outlining the initial introduction and evolution of atomic ideas based on the provided content:

after telling ai to genrate a flowchart

3. when clicked on maybe later in quiz suggestion the card deonst go....

4. an exmple reply from ai "3️⃣ Evolution of Modern Atomic Models The journey to understand matter's basic building blocks involved progressive refinements of atomic models:

| Model/Scientist | Core Idea | Evolution from Previous Models | | :---------------- | : 
SOURCE
 | : 
SOURCE
 - | | Dalton | Atoms were indivisible 
SOURCE
 . | Laid the groundwork for modern atomic theory based on chemical evidence [ 
SOURCE
 ]. | | Thomson | Proposed the "plum pudding" model: positive charge spread uniformly through a sphere, with electrons embedded like raisins 
SOURCE
 . | Showed that atoms contained electrons, challenging Dalton's indivisible atom concept 
SOURCE
 . This model explained electrical neutrality 
SOURCE
 . | | Rutherford | Proposed the nuclear model in 1911: a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons [ 
SOURCE
 ]. | Concentrated the positive charge in the nucleus, correcting Thomson's diffuse positive charge 
SOURCE
 . Explained scattering results 
SOURCE
 . However, Rutherford's classical orbits violated classical electromagnetic theory [ 
SOURCE
 ]. | | Bohr | Introduced quantized energy levels for electrons 
SOURCE
 . | Addressed the stability issue of Rutherford's model by introducing quantum mechanics. His model, however, could not explain multi-electron atoms 
SOURCE
 . | | Schrödinger | Developed wave mechanics, providing a complete quantum description of atoms 
SOURCE
 . | Offered a more comprehensive explanation, moving beyond Bohr's limitations with multi-electron atoms 
SOURCE

 i want instead of "source" i want some text from the ai reply related to the citation data to be appear in gren and when clicked on that green text it should lead to that page and heighlight the document...



 4. ai reply is not formatted properly...let it use proper markdown
