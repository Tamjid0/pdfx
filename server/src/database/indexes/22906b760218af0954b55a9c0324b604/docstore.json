[[["8c22674c-e65a-487a-bf44-afbac6fb3f5a",{"pageContent":"Dummy text, also called placeholder or filler text (most famously \" Lorem Ipsum \"), is meaningless text used in design (web, print, graphic) to show how a layout will look with content, letting designers focus on visual elements like fonts, spacing, and colors without getting distracted by actual meaning . It fills space in documents or webpages during development, resembling real text but conveying no message, with origins tracing back centuries to the printing industry. Key characteristics & purpose: ● Placeholder: Acts as a temporary stand-in for final content. ● Focus on visuals: Helps evaluate typography, layout, and design before real text is ready. ● Neutrality: Prevents readers from getting caught up in the words instead of the design.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}]],{"0":"8c22674c-e65a-487a-bf44-afbac6fb3f5a"}]
