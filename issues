ui issue:

1. hide icon is getting behind source...half of the icon is clickable

2.quiz chat icon is over next question text....

3. flashcard ui is so broken in single mode...too big text in sinlegle mode text getting out over card
also card are not flipping in single mode...and for now disable editing the card or like dobuble click should enable editing the card...


4. also quiz questions are also talking too much space with big text....use appropriate text size and fix the sizes...
also after completing a exam text and ui is so bold




logical and functional issues:


1.quiz hint not highlighting in pdf/slide

2.quiz chat returning raw markdown


3. there should not be hint or ask ai in exam mode....but at the end of the exam when shown all answers there should be option to hint and ask ai...
4. clicking on rtenegrate button accross all mode should use the presets that uses in that tab...so suppose in the beginning i choose page 1 and after generating i choose to regenrate then it should use only that 1 page in that tab...
and add a confirmation dop up for regenration....



now fix all iissues one by one
