1. there is a huge mismatch in the tabing syestm accross the modes....
suppose i open a new tab but it takes over the current tab and until i generate it shows the generation tools and ther is no way back except refresh...
instead clicking on plus icon should open a entire new tab.....wwith genration tools...if nothing was generated user can exit the tool with one click on cross no popup...
the tab should be named as draft no...there shouldnot be any current named default tab....
and right clicking on the tab from the navigation should let user rename the draft or tab
2. rfereshing while in the workspace leads to the import page evrytime.....but instead it should reload the worspace with current data.....


3. click back button while in a opend slide should act just like pdf where back button should reset the worspce withing editor mode.....current while clicking back gfro slide mode shows the slide content areas (empty) instead of editorand artboard
