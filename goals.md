i want to bring the app into a stable form with the current available feature...its ui stablity and and adding small new updates like 

1"one simple issue.....project overview card (when clicked on a project) shows import notes and summary and other items even though noting was generated in that project i think this is a bug...........

2.and btw show what contents has been generated in that project in the deafult card not the overview card...."......and fix similar type of issue through the site...

3. also add project searching feature with searchbox......

4. src/components/dashboard/VersionTabs.tsx (106:29) @ <unknown> when tried to change the version summary and all versions disappared after clicking...even thoyugh it had previously generated summary it all disappers and ask for new generation.....


5. also fix the content settings that are on right side bar....there some icons are broken while chking options for sttings....

6. in quiz mode [Evaluation

Auto-Grading

Performance Review] it has no use so either remove this fetaure or make it functional

7. double clicking one mode tabs that conatins content should allow user to rename the file....

8. current the history doesnt update after geenrating new content instantlly like im in insight mode and if i click on generate it generates new content but history still doent show it....and history should always show the rnamed version of the tab...

9. btw currently project filtering also not working

10. adittionally while ficix these things look for similar bugs or ui mismatch and fix them and clean the codebase...
